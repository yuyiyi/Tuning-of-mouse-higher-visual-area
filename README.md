# Recording mouse higher visual areas  
This is a large population neuron recording collected using a large field-of-view (LFOV) two-photon microscope featured in the simultaneous multi-region recording. 
The dataset contains population neuron activities recorded from mouse cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons labeled with GCamp6s. The animal is head-fixed and passively viewing a set of drifting texture stimuli, a set of random dot kinematogram (RDK) with different motion coherence, or a naturalistic video taken from a mouse home cage. 
The dataset was collected to investigate the encoding of texture and motion features in mouse V1 and higher visual areas (HVAs).

# Highlights
1. The dataset contains deconvolved spike timing which could fit models and analyze using methods that are designed for electrophysiology recordings.
2. Each recording session contains a simultaneous recording from at least two visual cortical areas which allows investigating inter-area interactions.
3. Texture and motion features of a naturalistic were extracted using designed filters.
