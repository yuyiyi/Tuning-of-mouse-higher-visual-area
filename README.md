# HVA_tuning
This is a dataset collected using a large-field-of-view two-photon microscope featured in the simultaneous multi-region recording. 
The dataset contains population neuron activities recorded from mouse cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons labeled with GCamp6s. The animal is head-fixed and passively viewing a set of drifting texture stimuli, a set of random dot kinematogram (RDK) with different motion coherence, or a naturalistic video taken from a mouse home cage. The dataset was collected to investigate the texture and motion encoding in mouse V1 and higher visual areas, as well as the interaction between V1 and HVAs.
